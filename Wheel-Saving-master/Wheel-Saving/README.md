Based on the resource of IllusiveThea (https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-save-wheel-position-no-more-wheel-snapping/51009)

As I had a problem by turning the wheels with custom cars (ELS,etc) I decided to see if I can figure out a fix myself. I've tried several attempts and found a working way on placing the wheels correctly!

# Installation
1. Download this folder
2. Create a folder in [resources] with the name "wheelsaving" (Or any optional name you like)
3. Place the content of the download inside this folder. 
4. Add your folder to server.cfg (example: start wheelsaving)
5. Start your server/ use /refresh and load the resource
6. Voila!
